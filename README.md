# Bowling Challenge

*As the great Walter Sobchak (as embodied by John Goodman) once said: "This is not 'Nam, this is bowling. There are rules.", and there is now no more need to worry about the rules of scoring as this app will keep score for you.*

This app allows users to keep track over their bowling score and automatically receive the appropriate bonuses. It was built over three days as part of the curriculum at the Makers Academy coding bootcamp.

## Getting started
Enter the following commands in your terminal:

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/heuperman/bowling-challenge.git`

## Usage
Enter the following commands in your terminal:

Change into the main directory:
`cd bowling-challenge`

Run the app:
*currently not available. App can be used via the console from the SpecRunner.html page.*

*screenshot will be inserted here*

## Running tests
This comes with a full feature test and unit tests with 100% coverage (determined using Karma and Istanbul).

To run all available tests in your browser type `open SpecRunner.html` in your terminal.

## To do
Given more time, I would have made the following additions:
  - Move tenth frame check into separate function and get rid of 'magic numbers'  
  - Extract bonus calculation into separate constructor function  
  - Create a simple browser based user interface  

## Built with
Jasmine, Istanbul and Karma -- as the JavaScript testing frameworks
