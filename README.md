# Bowling Challenge

*As the great Walter Sobchak (as embodied by John Goodman) once said: "This is not 'Nam, this is bowling. There are rules.", and there is now no more need to worry about the rules of scoring as this app will keep score for you.*

This app will allow users to keep track over their bowling score and automatically receive the appropriate bonusses. It was built over a weekend as part of the curriculum at the Makers Academy coding bootcamp.
